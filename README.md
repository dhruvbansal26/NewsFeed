## Project Overview

The Financial News Tracker is a personal project developed to scrape news from various financial websites and provide a platform for users to save articles of interest for future reading. The goal of this project was to learn and apply web development concepts using React.js instead of vanilla JavaScript, as well as gain experience in deploying a web application.

### Tech Stack Used

#### Front-End

- React.js (with Vite.js as the build tool)
- Bootstrap for styling

#### Back-End

- Node.js (with Express.js framework)
- Python (BeautifulSoup library for web scraping)

## Usage

The web application has a simple and user-friendly interface. New users can sign up for an account, while returning users can log in to access the features. Once logged in, users can navigate to the "News" tab to view up-to-date financial headlines and save articles they find interesting for later reading.

## Links

The Financial News Tracker scrapes news from the following websites:

- https://finance.yahoo.com
- https://www.marketwatch.com

Please note that these websites were selected for the project because they allowed web scraping, and the scraping process was relatively straightforward. The project is intended for learning purposes and does not serve any commercial or production use. I will try to add additional sites in the future.
